# Configuration

Aga is configured in a simple `toml` format. By default, it looks for `aga.toml`
in the current working directory; this is overridden by the `--config` CLI
option.

Here is the full list of configuration options, with defaults:

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: ../examples/aga.toml

```
