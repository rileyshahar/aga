# Development

We have tooling for a modern development workflow provided in an environment
based around `poetry`. If there's another workflow you like better, feel free to
use it, but just make sure you're writing good code, passing tests, and not
introducing additional linter errors. In particular, I will enforce conformance
with `black`.

## Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:nihilistkitten/aga.git && cd aga`.
2. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
3. Install dependencies: `poetry install`.
4. Activate the development environment: `poetry shell`.

I encourage you to set up integration between our dev tools and your editor, but
it's not strictly necessary; you can use them as you please, from their CLIs or
(I suppose) not at all. Regardless, the environment includes
[python-lsp-server](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server), which I
personally use for this purpose, and can be used via `lsp-mode` in emacs,
`atom-languageclient` in atom, or the built-in lsp support in neovim and vscode.

## Nox

The tool [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/) runs tooling in virtualized
environments. To both run tests and lints, run `nox -r` (`-r` prevents nox from
reinstalling the environments across multiple runs, which saves significant
time.)

## Testing

Testing depends on [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/). To run tests, simply run
`pytest` from within the poetry shell. To run tests via nox, run `nox -rs test`.

Code coverage information can be generated by `pytest --cov`. This happens by
default in nox runs.

There are some network-bound end-to-end tests which are not fun by default. You
can run these with `pytest -m slow` or `nox -rs test_slow`.

## Linting

A number of static analysis tools are available in the development environment:

- [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/), a static type analysis tool.
- [pylint](https://pylint.org/), a general-purpose linter.
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), a highly modular linter.
- [flake8-black](https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-black), a code formatting
- checker. [flake8-bugbear](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear), which
- makes `flake8` stricter. [pydocstyle](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/), a
- documentation linter.

These tend to be quite strict, but after a while you'll get used to them, and
they help write _much_ better code.

To run all lints, run `nox -rs lint`.

## Formatting

We use two tools to enforce a uniform code style:

- [black](https://github.com/psf/black), a highly opinionated code formatter.
- [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort), an import sorter.

To run both formatters, run `nox -rs fmt`. This is _not_ run by default runs of
nox.

# Maintenance

Here I describe how to do common/regular maintenance tasks.

## Bump python version

We like to keep the default python version under which tests are run as the most
recent stable version (currently 3.10), so that students don't unknowingly rely
on new language features and have to debug versioning differences between their
machine and the autograder. Right now, to fix this, we need to:

1. Update the documentation: just grep for `3.10` and replace it with the new
   version.
2. Update the gradescope build: this is handled in `setup.sh`; you need to
   install a different version and change the version we execute the scripts
   with.
3. Add the new version to be tested in the `noxfile`.
4. Adjust the shebang of the `run_autograder` executable.
5. Adjust `.readthedocs.yml` to build the docs on the newest python.
